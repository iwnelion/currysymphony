An example website for an Indian restaurant, named Curry Symphony.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS
Using simple HTML elements, I created a one-page restaurant website that includes: the home-hero part, a menu, a blog, an about us and a contact section. At the top, there is a menu that leads to each of these sections. For the menu and the blog layout, I used flexbox.

## Optimizations

If I continued this project, I would add interaction with the user, I would add the ability to call or send an email by clicking at the phone and the email, as well as show the restaurant's location on a map in the website. Also, instead of a static image on the hero section, there could have been a carousel or more pictures for the user to slide through.

## Lessons Learned:

With this project I had the chance to practice on the use of flexbox, as well as searching for material for a website on my own.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
